## Open Source Story 
Let's combine our forces to create amazing stories together ! These projects will be shared later on on our social media, and we'll shine some limelight on all the participants who brought these works of art to life.

#### 1. Suggest A Story Idea
Got an interesting plot to share? Add a `story-title.md` file to this directory (ex: `TuxJourney.md`). <br/>
Use any combination of content and [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) you'd like. Here is an example:
```markdown
# Story Title 
## Synopsis: 
An essential element to keep the story running smoothly and allow the action to develop in a logical way that the reader can follow. 
## Setting: 
The setting is the location and time period of the action. An author should describe the environment or surroundings of the story in such detail that the reader feels that he or she can picture the scene. Unusual settings (such as a fantasy world) can be interesting, but everyday settings can help a reader to better visualize the story and feel connected to the plot! 
## Characters: 
The characters are the individuals that the story is about. The author should introduce the characters in the story with enough information that the reader can visualize each person. This is achieved by providing detailed descriptions of a character’s physical attributes and personality traits. Every story should have a main character. The main character determines the way the plot will develop and is usually who will solve the problem the story centers upon.
```

#### 2. Suggest Story Board
You're not good at expressing yourself through words but you're great at planning? modify the story-title.md file of your choice and add story board/plot to help other contributors organize their ideas ! Here's an example: 

```markdown
## Plot: 
The plot is the actual story around which the entire book is based. A plot should have a very clear beginning, middle, and end—with all the necessary descriptions and suspense, called exposition—so that the reader can make sense of the action and follow along from start to finish. 
## Conflict: 
Every story has a confl ict to solve. The plot is centered on this confl ict and the ways in which the characters attempt to resolve the problem. When the story’s action becomes most exciting, right before the resolution, it is called the climax. 
## Resolution: 
The solution to the problem is the way the action is resolved. For example, Katie often resolves a confl ict by fi nding a compromise for two fi ghting characters or helping fix any mistakes she made while switcherooed into someone else. It is important that the resolution fi t the rest of the story in tone and creativity and solve all parts of the conflict. 
```

#### 3. Write Away
The story elements and plot are both ready. Now's the time for the pen(or keyboard) warriors to shine. Put on your armor and put out your thoughts on the story of your choice.
