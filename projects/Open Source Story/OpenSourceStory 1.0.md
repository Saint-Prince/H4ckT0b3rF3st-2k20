Once apon a time there was this evil tech corporate called ColosedSource that used the massive amount of money they had to buy small tech companies on the rise so that they make sure that they stay the only dominent tech company in the world 

For many years, Peaple have aspired to build a teh company that could rival ClosedSource and finaly end it's monopoly on the market, but that was easier said then done, ClosedSource had a big lead with alot of data cummulated on it's users, but that was also a weakness, as ClosedSource keept cumulating data on it's users, they themselfs became scared of what that could represent, they had no idea what their data was done with, no idea how thier technologie worked and if there wasn't any malisious features hidden inside it.

This era of ClosedSource's reign keept for a long time until one day, a Hero emerged with a briliant idea down in his old garage in Bouse9loul, you see for a long time people tried to fight ClosedSource individualy forming startups that couldn't last long because of the dominance of ClosedSource, those startups either ended up bankrupt or bought by this evil corporation, but what if you could make something that can't either be bankrupt or bought, something free from ownership that could finaly break the circle, this is when our hero who 
goes by the name of Lius Pingun ak on the internet as BirdThatCannotFly bagan his work, since the ClosedCorp's biggest product was web browser that the entire world used, he also made a browser,as he was woking on it he decided to call his browser WaterPuinguin in reference to his alaias,but how could he make a browser that could rival one that has been so in some many years of development, well this is where the briliant idea of Lius comes into play, once he had a fonctioning 1.0 version of his browser, he uploaded it to his quit famous tech forum called Lius Tech Tips, this forum was hosted in his own Bouse9loul garage to avoid censorship from ClosedSource and had gained quite a traction among tech enthousiasts, but he didn't just upload an executable, HE UPLOADED THE WHOLE CODE, this message was clear, i did my part, now it's time to do yours, the thread he made is still known to this day as the most visited web page on the planet, it's name was OPERATION OPENSOURCE.....
