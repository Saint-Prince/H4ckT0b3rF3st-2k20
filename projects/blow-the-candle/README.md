## Blow The Candle
Blow The Candle is a static website. I made this website to troll my friend on his birthday and I invite you all to do the same.

### Usage
1. Clone repository or download project files.
2. Browse to this folder.
2. Open index.html file on your favorite browser.

### Tasks
Here are some things you can do to contribute:
1. Fix the wanky animation.
2. I suck at javascript, there are a million and one ways you can make the js code more optimized and less awful.
3. Stop the flame from going out of frame.
3. The first and second animations are starting at the same time, it would be better if the second animation only starts after the user hovers over the flame.
4. Add a flame sound that plays on the background.

### Preview
* You can preview the project [here](https://justzlabiyastuff.tech/).
