He decided to go to a Time travel conference, animated by a has-been washed up scientist, too busy regurgitating some random theory made up on 4chan. But as the situation became more boring, suddenly a shout was heard, a shout of extreme pain. Going towards there, he discovers the body of a girl, dead covered and drenched in blood.

As he took his phone, as a first reaction, to call his best friend to tell him about the dead situation, everything crumbles for him, and a severe pain to the head is followed by the disappearance of everyone on the street of tokyo...and the appearance of a satelite, on the very site of the Conference...
