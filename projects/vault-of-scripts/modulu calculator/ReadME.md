## Modulo calculator
This calculator calculates the Modulo operator (%) using basic mathematics to show how it works

the modulo operator(%) gives you the rest of a division

basically if we devide a number k by a number f we get this equation

k = q x f + r 

q being how many of f is in k and r the rest 

the modulo operator % gives you the r value

### Setup

### Usage 
``` bash
cd 'python-file-directory'
python modulo-calc.py
```

### Tasks
 * add a GUI(Graphic User Interface / menu)
