## Leave Me Alone
Are you also antisocial? Do you also sometimes feel that social duties are painful to perform? This is a python script that allows you to be left alone to your 
gears by shouldering your 'responsibility' of replying to messages sent to your inbox.
When executed, this script sends an automated facebook reply to the messages that were sent to you after x amount of time. 

### Setup 
You need to install fbchat:
``` bash
pip install fbchat
```

### Usage 
``` bash
cd 'python-file-directory'
python main.py 
```
Or you can execute it like this:
``` bash
cd 'python-file-directory'
python main.py > echo.txt
```
in order to inspect the results of the script.

### Tasks
Here are things you can do to complete this implementation:
* Add more custom messages to the list (they have to be messages that fit all contexts and situations)
* Add more features to make it seem like you're engaged with the conversation
* Improve my stupid code
* Be creative!
