# PC-health
PC-health is a script that you can use to check the health of your PC (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors).

_This script seems stupid but it is a good step to get started with interacting with os using python._
### Setup
Firt at all you need to install psutil and shutil libraries.
``` bash
pip install psutil shutil
```
### How it works
Just run the following command in your working directory.
``` bash
python pc_health.py
```

### Tasks
This script can be better by adding new features and good ux console.


1. Add a menu where you can choose what you want to check.
2. Add check network features.
3. Add check sensors features. 
4. Any idea is welcomed.
