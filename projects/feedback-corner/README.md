## Feedback Corner 
This is the feedbck corner. Imagine both Yahoo! and Twitter combined and this is precisely what you'll get. 

## How to contribute? 
#### 1. Ask for feedback/suggestions
Do you have unanswered questions you want to share? Do you want to request suggestions on a certain topic? Aside from your friends, the Open Source community is the right place to go to. Share with us all of your concerns by creating a `username_subject.md` (ex: openmindsclub_installparty.md) file in this directory and let the magic happen.

#### 2. Give feedback/suggestions
If you have time to spare, browse the subjects other participants have pushed to this directory and share with them your different thoughts and opinions.
